These prints bear witness to a Naxi script unification movement initiated by Dongba ritualists in the Lijiang Basin during the first half of the 20th century, holding significant historical importance in the development of Naxi script. This article describes the features and contents of these woodblocks; through an investigation of the historical events related to the script unification, it corrects the dating of the woodblocks and analyzes the cultural background and deeper reasons for the interruption of this Naxi script unification movement.},

	abstract = {Dongba manuscripts are traditional Chinese texts written in pictographic Dongba script. The Dongba script likely originated in the early Tang dynasty, and no later than the Northern Song dynasty in the 11th century. The distribution of the Dongba manuscripts corresponds to the distribution of the eastern and western dialects of the Naxi ethnic group. Dongba manuscripts from different regions exhibit significant differences in character forms and writing styles, displaying regional characteristics. Dongba manuscripts are categorized into four regions based on their distribution: the first region features small characters, simple strokes, and a rustic style; the second region features round and delicate characters with even strokes; the third region mainly features three-line scripts with concise strokes and clear writing and with varying spacing; the fourth region features more annotated characters, denser lines, reduced spacing between characters, and a variety of ways to convey meaning and pronunciation. The geographical distribution of Dongba manuscripts is closely related to surrounding ethnic groups such as the Han, Tibetan, Bai, and Lisu.},

	abstract = {This paper comprehensively summarizes, analyses, and reviews Iravatham Mahadevan’s attempts to decipher the Indus script. Spanning a period of over thirty five years, Iravatham Mahadevan made continuous attempts to interpret and decipher the Indus script. Mahadevan claimed to have adapted the method of parallels between the symbolic representation and the text, between the written object and its designation, between the written symbol itself and its meaning, and the similarity throughout the ancient East of certain portions of the inscriptions, with the assumption that the underlying language of the script is Dravidian. Mahadevan was very flexible in changing his views and finding new interpretations, and gradually he shifted his interpretation of Indus signs from being phonetic/logographic/word to ideographic, leaving unshaken his core personal hypothesis and belief in the Veḷier clan and Tamil cultural settings. While Mahadevan did not succeed in making a self-consistent system of readings applicable to a large number of discovered pieces of writings, he did make a determined, persistent effort to develop a Dravidian framework for deciphering of the Indus script. This study seeks to find weaknesses in the methodology and assumptions of Mahadevan and searches for possible alternatives within that framework.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The “Silk Road” has referred to the roads or the road networks that facilitated East–West communication, with ancient China as the starting point in the East. For a long time, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, known as the “roof of the world,” has not been included in discussions of the Silk Road, as it has been generally understood as dangerous for overland passage due to its location in the alpine snow region, challenging natural environment, and sparse population. As a result, few references on East–West passage through the plateau have been found in the historical records, in both the Chinese and Tibetan languages. However, archaeological discoveries in recent years have shown that from prehistoric times the early people on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau began their communication and exchanges with the outside world in various ways. No later than the Han and the Jin dynasties, the traditional “Land Silk Road” had extended its trunk routes into the plateau. During the Tang dynasty, as the Tubo kingdom expanded continuously, it built a relatively stable transportation and road network that connected it with South, Central, and East Asia, which this article terms the “Plateau Silk Road.” The formation of the Plateau Silk Road was of great significance, as it not only connected the “Land Silk Road” and the “Steppe Silk Road” in North China as well as the “Maritime Silk Road” and the “Southwest Silk Road” in South China as a whole, but also played an irreplaceable role in integrating the western territories of China and the ethnic groups inhabiting these territories into the Chinese national community. In this process, the ancient people of all ethnic groups on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau made important historical contributions.},

The article aims to supplement established theories on the rich material culture of this region. It will look in particular at the development of its striking bronze metallurgy, largely deriving from the established traditions of the Yellow River valley in China’s Bronze Age. It highlights the function of a dense network of trading routes, referred to in modern scholarship as the “Southwest Silk Road”, as an important facilitator of cultural and artistic exchange and reciprocation from ancient times.},

Two scripts that had a one-to-one matching of their signs were determined to be related. The result of the analysis is the finding of the following three groups, which are listed in chronological order: (1) Sumerian pictograms, the Indus Valley script, and the proto-Elamite script; (2) Cretan hieroglyphs and Linear B; and (3) the Phoenician, Greek, and Brahmi alphabets. Based on their geographic locations and times of appearance, Group (1) may originate from Mesopotamia in the early Bronze Age, Group (2) may originate from Europe in the middle Bronze Age, and Group (3) may originate from the Sinai Peninsula in the late Bronze Age.},

              Ever since the discovery of Indus valley civilization, scholars have debated the linguistic identities of its people. This study analyzes numerous archaeological, linguistic, archaeogenetic and historical evidences to claim that the words used for elephant (like, ‘pīri’, ‘pīru’) in Bronze Age Mesopotamia, the elephant-word used in the Hurrian part of an Amarna letter of ca. 1400 {BC}, and the ivory-word (‘pîruš’) recorded in certain sixth century {BC} Old Persian documents, were all originally borrowed from ‘pīlu’, a Proto-Dravidian elephant-word, which was prevalent in the Indus valley civilization, and was etymologically related to the Proto-Dravidian tooth-word ‘*pal’ and its alternate forms (‘*pīl’/‘*piḷ’/‘*pel’). This paper argues that there is sufficient morphophonemic evidence of an ancient Dravidian ‘*piḷ’/‘*pīl’-based root, which meant ‘splitting/crushing’, and was semantically related to the meanings ‘tooth/tusk’. This paper further observes that ‘pīlu’ is among the most ancient and common phytonyms of the toothbrush tree
              Salvadora persica
              , which is a characteristic flora of Indus valley, and whose roots and twigs have been widely used as toothbrush in {IVC} regions since antiquity. This study claims that this phytonym ‘pīlu’ had also originated from the same Proto-Dravidian tooth-word, and argues that since {IVC} people had named their toothbrush trees and tuskers (elephants) using a Proto-Dravidian tooth-word, and since these names were widely used across {IVC} regions, a significant population of Indus valley civilization must have used that Proto-Dravidian tooth-word in their daily communication. Since ‘tooth’ belongs to the core non-borrowable ultraconserved vocabulary of a speech community, its corollary is that a significant population of {IVC} spoke certain ancestral Dravidian languages. Important insights from recent archaeogenetic studies regarding possible migration of Proto-Dravidian speakers from Indus valley to South India also corroborate the findings of this paper.},

We demonstrate the impossibility of the lost-manuscript thesis and show that Indus symbols were not even evolving in linguistic directions after at least 600 years of use. Suggestions as to how Indus symbols were used are noted in nonlinguistic symbol systems in the Near East that served key religious, political and social functions without encoding speech or serving as formal memory aids. Evidence is reviewed that the Harappans' lack of a true script may have been tied to the role played by their symbols in controlling large multilinguistic populations; parallels are drawn to the later resistance of Brahmin elites to the literate encoding of Vedic sources and to similar phenomena in esoteric traditions outside South Asia. Discussion is provided on some of the political and academic forces that helped sustain the Indus-script myth for over 130 years and on ways in which our findings transform current views of the Indus Valley and of literacy in the ancient world in general.},

They establish key phases in the population prehistory of Eurasia, including the spread of farming peoples from the Near East, with movements both westward and eastward. The people known as the Yamnaya in the Bronze Age also moved both westward and eastward from a focal area located north of the Black Sea. The overall patterns of genetic clines reflect similar and parallel patterns in South Asia and Europe.

            Genome-wide analysis of ancient {DNA} from more than 500 individuals from Central and South Asia illuminates the spread of Indo-European languages.
          , 
            
              {RATIONALE}
              To elucidate the extent to which the major cultural transformations of farming, pastoralism, and shifts in the distribution of languages in Eurasia were accompanied by movement of people, we report genome-wide ancient {DNA} data from 523 individuals spanning the last 8000 years, mostly from Central Asia and northernmost South Asia.
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              The movement of people following the advent of farming resulted in genetic gradients across Eurasia that can be modeled as mixtures of seven deeply divergent populations. A key gradient formed in southwestern Asia beginning in the Neolithic and continuing into the Bronze Age, with more Anatolian farmer–related ancestry in the west and more Iranian farmer–related ancestry in the east. This cline extended to the desert oases of Central Asia and was the primary source of ancestry in peoples of the Bronze Age Bactria Margiana Archaeological Complex ({BMAC}). This supports the idea that the archaeologically documented dispersal of domesticates was accompanied by the spread of people from multiple centers of domestication.
              The main population of the {BMAC} carried no ancestry from Steppe pastoralists and did not contribute substantially to later South Asians. However, Steppe pastoralist ancestry appeared in outlier individuals at {BMAC} sites by the turn of the second millennium {BCE} around the same time as it appeared on the southern Steppe. Using data from ancient individuals from the Swat Valley of northernmost South Asia, we show that Steppe ancestry then integrated further south in the first half of the second millennium {BCE}, contributing up to 30\% of the ancestry of modern groups in South Asia. The Steppe ancestry in South Asia has the same profile as that in Bronze Age Eastern Europe, tracking a movement of people that affected both regions and that likely spread the unique features shared between Indo-Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages.
              The primary ancestral population of modern South Asians is a mixture of people related to early Holocene populations of Iran and South Asia that we detect in outlier individuals from two sites in cultural contact with the Indus Valley Civilization ({IVC}), making it plausible that it was characteristic of the {IVC}. After the {IVC}’s decline, this population mixed with northwestern groups with Steppe ancestry to form the “Ancestral North Indians” ({ANI}) and also mixed with southeastern groups to form the “Ancestral South Indians” ({ASI}), whose direct descendants today live in tribal groups in southern India. Mixtures of these two post-{IVC} groups—the {ANI} and {ASI}—drive the main gradient of genetic variation in South Asia today.
            
            
              {CONCLUSION}
              Earlier work recorded massive population movement from the Eurasian Steppe into Europe early in the third millennium {BCE}, likely spreading Indo-European languages. We reveal a parallel series of events leading to the spread of Steppe ancestry to South Asia, thereby documenting movements of people that were likely conduits for the spread of Indo-European languages.
              
                
                  The Bronze Age spread of Yamnaya Steppe pastoralist ancestry into two subcontinents—Europe and South Asia.
                  Pie charts reflect the proportion of Yamnaya ancestry, and dates reflect the earliest available ancient {DNA} with Yamnaya ancestry in each region. Ancient {DNA} has not yet been found for the {ANI} and {ASI}, so for these the range is inferred statistically.
                
                
              
            
          , 
            By sequencing 523 ancient humans, we show that the primary source of ancestry in modern South Asians is a prehistoric genetic gradient between people related to early hunter-gatherers of Iran and Southeast Asia. After the Indus Valley Civilization’s decline, its people mixed with individuals in the southeast to form one of the two main ancestral populations of South Asia, whose direct descendants live in southern India. Simultaneously, they mixed with descendants of Steppe pastoralists who, starting around 4000 years ago, spread via Central Asia to form the other main ancestral population. The Steppe ancestry in South Asia has the same profile as that in Bronze Age Eastern Europe, tracking a movement of people that affected both regions and that likely spread the distinctive features shared between Indo-Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages.},

Did the Harappans follow monastic ideals that later contributed to Buddhism and Jainism? Was their script like today's emojis, conveying ideas? Why are there images of rivalry, but no images of war and no images of romance either to be found at the Harappan sites? Why did the cities disappear while the villages continued to flourish? An eventful century later, Devdutt Pattanaik uses the lens of mythology to reflect on this most mysterious of 'peaceful' civilizations, now spread across geographies in India and Pakistan.

Building on previous structural analyses, which reveal that Indus script was semasiographic and/or logographic in nature, this study analyses the combinatorial patterns of Indus script signs, and the geographical distribution of the inscriptions, to establish that the inscriptions did not encode any proper noun, such as anthroponyms, toponyms, or names of specific organizations. Analyzing various archaeological contexts of the inscribed objects—e.g., seals found concentrated near city gates (e.g., Harappa), craft workshops (e.g., Chanhu-daro), and public buildings (e.g., Mohenjo-daro), often along with standardized Indus weights that were used for taxation; sealings attached to various storage containers and locking systems of “warehouse” chambers as indicated by their reverse-side impressions (e.g., the sealings of Lothal “warehouse”); inscribed sealing-pendants of Kanmer, conjectured to be passports/gate-passes by archaeologists; and seals with identical inscriptions often found from distant settlements—this study claims that the inscribed stamp-seals were primarily used for enforcing certain rules involving taxation, trade/craft control, commodity control and access control. Considering typological and functional differences between the seals and tablets, and analyzing certain numerical and metrological notations (, , , ) typically found at the reverse sides of many two-sided tablets whose obverse sides contain seal-like inscriptions, this study argues that such tablets were possibly trade/craft/commodity-specific licenses issued to tax-collectors, traders, and artisans. These reverse-side tablet inscriptions possibly encoded certain standardized license fees for certain fixed license slabs, whereas their obverse-side inscriptions specified the commercial activities licensed to the tablet-bearers. These seals/tablets were possibly issued by certain guilds of merchants/artisans, and/or region-based rulers or governing bodies, who collaborated in the integration phase of {IVC}, to standardize certain taxation rules and trade/craft regulations across settlements. The seal/tablet iconographies might have been the emblems of the guilds, rulers, and/or governing bodies.},

	abstract = {The Dongba manuscripts are a unique primitive pictographic writing system that originated among the Naxi people of Lijiang, China, boasting over a thousand years of history. The uniqueness of the Dongba manuscripts stems from their pronounced pictorial and ideographic characteristics. However, the digital preservation and inheritance of Dongba manu manuscripts face multiple challenges, including extracting its rich semantic information, recognizing individual characters, retrieving Dongba manuscripts, and automatically interpreting the meanings of Dongba manuscripts. Developing efficient Dongba character detection technology has become a key research focus, wherein establishing a standardized Dongba detection dataset is crucial for training and evaluating techniques. In this study, we have created a comprehensive Dongba manuscripts detection dataset covering various commonly used Dongba characters and vocabularies. Additionally, we propose a model named {STEF}. Firstly, the Swin Transformer extracts the complex structures and diverse shapes of Dongba manuscripts’ features. Then, by introducing a Feature Pyramid Enhancement Module, features of different sizes are cascaded to preserve multi-scale information. Subsequently, all features are fused in a {FUSION} module, resulting in features of various Dongba manuscript styles. Each pixel’s binarisation threshold is dynamically adjusted through a differentiable binarisation operation, accurately distinguishing between foreground Dongba manuscripts and background. Lastly, deformable convolution is introduced, allowing the model to dynamically adjust the convolution kernel’s size and shape based on the Dongba manuscripts’ size, thereby better capturing the detailed information of Dongba characters of different sizes. Experimental results show that {STEF} achieves a recall rate of 88.88\%, a precision rate of 88.65\%, and an F-measure of 88.76\%, outperforming other text detection algorithms. Visualization experiments demonstrate that {STEF} performs well in detecting Dongba manuscripts of various sizes, shapes, and styles, especially in blurred handwriting and complex backgrounds.},

This article reveals how the primarily logographic Naxi dongba script (often labelled the world's 'last living pictographs'), used in China's southwestern Yunnan province to record the Naxi language, can be practically used as a modern writing system alongside its more widely known traditional role as a means of recording religious rites, and what exactly separates these two styles of writing. The efforts that have been made to achieve the goal of modernisation over the past decades are reviewed, including the longstanding attempts at Unicode encoding. I make some suggestions for the future development of the script, and employ plenty of examples from recent publications, alongside phonetic renderings and English translations. It is hoped that overall awareness of this unique script can be raised, and that it can develop into a vernacular script with everyday applications.},

	abstract = {The scope of the present thesis is to analyze the major variabilities among Indus settlements and urban infrastruc ture of the ancient Indus society during 2600-1900BCE. This includes the process of urbanization in relation 
with population, settled area, and location of the major urban centers. The impact of urbanization on the regional 
environment is also discussed. Thus, the aim of the thesis is to analyze the urban infrastructure of the Indus society 
by comparing the available archaeological data from the largest urban settlements. In addition, urban process and 
development of the Indus region is compared with the Mesopotamia region. 
Mesopotamia and the Indus society are Bronze Age (6000-1900BCE) urban societies that present large, dense, 
and planned cities, but the study of urban processes and the environment is limited. The urban process from specific 
regions of both ancient societies is compared at different levels. At the primary level, comparative method and urban 
scaling theory is applied to examine the similarities and differences among major urban settlements of the Indus re gion during 2600-1900BCE. Available archaeological material from the largest settlements of Indus society are used 
to compare. A limited set of artefacts from Mohenjo Daro, Harappa and Ganweriwala are analysed and compared by 
{SEM}-{EDX} method. Results of {SEM}-{EDX} analysis shows that these artefacts were produced locally. Special attention 
is given to Ganweriwala settlement that is the least investigated settlement of the Indus region. The major shortcom ing to understanding urban infrastructure of the Indus society is the lack of knowledge about Ganweriwala settle ment. That shortcoming is addressed in the present work. The urban scale of Ganweriwala settlement is analyzed by 
an attribute-based approach. The results from the surface and artefacts study of Ganweriwala suggest that it was a 
major urban center during Indus urban period 2600-1900BCE. It shared the similar cultural expression with other 
major urban centers such as settlement plan, types of artefacts, written script on tablets and some types of figurines. 
Using Ganweriwala data as a case study for Indus urban infrastructure, I suggest that the Indus urban infrastructure 
is a complex phenomenon with greater similarities and lesser variabilities. Five major urban centers had different 
urban and socio-economic scales. The results of the present study suggest that Ancient Indus society exhibits complex 
patterns of urbanism that are rare in other ancient society. Indus society was regionally more expanded than Mes opotamia, but had a limited number of major urban centers. These urban centers were operated at different scales 
and exhibit greater similarities and fewer variabilities. The present research also contributes to the theoretical and 
empirical understanding of Ganweriwala settlement in relation to the environment, which has never been studied or 
reported before. 
At the secondary level, the settlements of the Diyala region of Mesopotamia are compared with the Cholistan 
region settlements of Indus society to analyze the similarities and differences of urban process and its impact on the 
environment. The largest settlement from Mesopotamia known as Uruk and the largest settlement from the Indus 
region known as Mohenjo Daro are also compared. The conclusion reached by comparing the settlement data of the 
Diyala region of Mesopotamia and the Cholistan region of Indus society suggests that settlements of the Cholistan 
were denser than the Diyala region. In the Cholistan region, a total abandonment of settlements happened around 
1900BCE. However, in the Diyala region there was still continuity of settlements around 1900BCE. Major urban 
settlements from both societies also contain variabilities such as they had different settlement plan, they were con structed with different materials, and they had different type of environment. It is also concluded that the nature of 
urban development and the process at respective macro regions was different.},

            This study conducts an epigraphic analysis of the yet undeciphered inscriptions of the ancient Indus Valley civilization and seeks to prove that just like proto-cuneiform administrative tablets of ancient Mesopotamia, or modern fiscal stamps and ration tokens, Indus seals and tablets too were formalized data-carriers that used both document-specific and linguistic syntaxes to convey messages. Analyzing various combinatorial patterns of Indus signs (e.g., typical co-occurrence restrictions present between some signs; tendency of some signs to form collocations; syntactic order(s) maintained between certain signs; strong positional preferences demonstrated by some signs; and the capability of certain signs to occur alone in inscriptions), this paper argues that Indus signs represented different content-morphemes and functional-morphemes—not phonograms used for spelling words—the majority of the inscriptions were logographic. Categorizing several Indus logograms into nine functional classes, it explores the way each sign-class has played unique functional roles for conveying complete messages through the brief inscriptions. By glossing the signs of the inscriptions using the names of their respective functional classes the study unravels the formulaic phrase-structures maintained by the majority of the inscriptions, where signs identified as phrase-final signs typically occur at the terminal positions of the semantic phrases, while signs used as connective-morphemes join semantically autonomous constituents in certain subordinating and coordinating ways, to form longer composite inscriptions. The study identifies certain Indus signs as numerical and metrological signs, which frequently collocate with specific lexemes, and clearly quantifying them in certain ways. This article also analyses the underlying relationships between certain metrological and phrase-final signs; examines the compositional nature of Indus collocations; and argues that some of the repeated sign-sequences were probable examples of linguistic reduplication. Analyzing the occasional occurrences of certain attributive quantifier signs as substantive lexemes, this paper suggests that in some inscriptional contexts those quantifier signs possibly represented certain commonly used metonyms of Indus civilization. Finally, this study explores the compositional semantics of Indus inscriptions without assigning any sound value to the signs and without speculating about whether the script encoded the speech of any specific ancient language.},

	abstract = {The Indus Civilization, often denoted by its major city Harappa, spanned almost two millennia from 3200 to 1300 {BC}. Its tradition reaches back to 7000 {BC}: a 5000 year long expansion of villages and towns, of trading activity, and of technological advancements culminates between 2600 and 1900 {BC} in the build-up of large cities, writing, and political authority; it emerges as one of the first great civilizations in history. During the ensuing 600 years, however, key technologies fall out of use, urban centers are depopulated, and people emigrate from former core settlement areas. Although many different hypotheses have been put forward to explain this deurbanization, a conclusive causal chain has not yet been established. We here combine literature estimates on brick typology, and on urban area for individual cities. In the context of the existing extensive data on Harappan artifact find sites and put in their chronological context, the combined narratives told by bricks, cities, and spatial extent can provide a new point of departure for discussing the possible reasons for the mysterious "decline".},

Urbanism flourished in the western region of the Indo-Gangetic Plain for approximately 600 y, but since approximately 3,900 y ago, the total settled area and settlement sizes declined, many sites were abandoned, and a significant shift in site numbers and density towards the east is recorded. We report morphologic and chronologic evidence indicating that fluvial landscapes in Harappan territory became remarkably stable during the late Holocene as aridification intensified in the region after approximately 5,000 {BP}. Upstream on the alluvial plain, the large Himalayan rivers in Punjab stopped incising, while downstream, sedimentation slowed on the distinctive mega-fluvial ridge, which the Indus built in Sindh. This fluvial quiescence suggests a gradual decrease in flood intensity that probably stimulated intensive agriculture initially and encouraged urbanization around 4,500 {BP}. However, further decline in monsoon precipitation led to conditions adverse to both inundation- and rain-based farming. Contrary to earlier assumptions that a large glacier-fed Himalayan river, identified by some with the mythical Sarasvati, watered the Harappan heartland on the interfluve between the Indus and Ganges basins, we show that only monsoonal-fed rivers were active there during the Holocene. As the monsoon weakened, monsoonal rivers gradually dried or became seasonal, affecting habitability along their courses. Hydroclimatic stress increased the vulnerability of agricultural production supporting Harappan urbanism, leading to settlement downsizing, diversification of crops, and a drastic increase in settlements in the moister monsoon regions of the upper Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.

            {AUTHOR} {SUMMARY}
            
              The collapse of the Bronze Age Harappan or Indus Civilization remains an enigma (
              1
              ). The Harappans inhabited the Indus plain at the arid edge of the monsoonal belt and developed one of the earliest urban civilizations over a territory larger than the contemporary extent of Egypt and Mesopotamia combined (
              Fig. P1
              A
              ). Between the Indus and Ganges watersheds, a now largely defunct drainage system, the Ghaggar-Hakra, was also heavily populated during Harappan times. Controlled by the monsoon and the melting of Himalayan snow, the variable hydrologic regime must have been a concern for Harappans, as it is today for a billion people living on the Indo-Gangetic Plain. We investigate how climate change affected this civilization by focusing on fluvial morphodynamics, which constitutes a critical gap in our current understanding of the Harappan environment. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission ({SRTM}) data combined with field surveys and radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence dating offer us a way to analyze fluvial landforms and date deposits of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. We reexamine archaeological site distribution in relation to climate changes and argue for a gradual decrease in flood intensity leading to a cumulative process of settlement shift eastwards, rather than a sudden collapse linked to a single arid event.

              Climate Change and the Harappans.
              
                Inundation agriculture during the winter was dominant along the Indus from the Harappan era until modern times. Hydroclimate reconstructions for South and Central Asia (Fig. 4) show that precipitation from both monsoon and westerly sources was at its lowest after approximately 4,000 y {BP} (
                3
                ). Aridification would have diminished flood intensity and allowed agriculture to expand along rivers. However, our analysis of fluvial landscapes suggests that further drying was detrimental for the Harappans, who relied on annual floods to sustain their economy. Preservation of archaeological sites at locations seemingly vulnerable to flooding, erosion, or burial suggest that, as aridity intensified, monsoon-augmented floods became less frequent and/or less intense. The most spectacular case of climate-controlled landscape transformation is the Ghaggar-Hakra system, which became ephemeral and was largely abandoned after approximately 4,000 y ago. Posturban settlements are preferentially located near the regularly flooded region at the Indus confluence with the Punjabi rivers, or in eastern regions with more reliable rains. Diversification of agriculture towards summer rain-based crops and the increase in drought-tolerant crops at the end of the urban phase (see
                
                  {SI} Text
                
                ) reveal efforts to adapt to hydroclimatic stress. Although snowmelt continued to provide water to the Indus and its Himalayan tributaries, the Harappans did not develop canal irrigation. In contrast to inhabitants of Mesopotamia and Egypt, which were surrounded by arid lands, the Harappans had the option to migrate toward more humid regions of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Migration toward the periphery could have contributed to the decline of urban centers in the core region of the Harappan domain. Without striving for deterministic explanations for the Indus Civilization collapse, it is likely that the unprecedented scale of hydroclimatic stress must have increased the vulnerability of floodwater farmers in Harappan society.
              
            
            
              Settlement Dynamics in the Harappan Domain.
              
                Occurrence of Harappan sites within the incised valleys of Punjab (
                Fig. P1
                B
                and
                C
                ) indicates that rivers were already entrenched by approximately 5,200 y ago. Numerous sites are located at the confluence zone of the Indus with the Punjabi rivers, where backwater flooding would have been common. Settlements on the Punjabi interfluves, including Harappa itself, tend to occur near their edges, close to fertile, annually flooded areas. Farther to the east, Harappan sites occur in the upper region of the Ghaggar-Hakra domain (Haryana and upper Punjab), but also along and within the incised valley of the Yamuna and on the Yamuna-Ganga interfluve. Settling of the Ghaggar-Hakra took advantage of the smaller floods typical for non-Himalayan monsoonal rivers. However, the largest agglomeration of mature Harappan sites, including the urban Ganweriwala, occurs on the lowermost Ghaggar-Hakra palaeochannel system in modern Cholistan. Proximity to both Ghaggar-Hakra and the well-watered confluence of the Indus with its Punjabi tributaries provides the best explanation for the continuity and high-density occupation there. Harappan discoveries in the Thar Desert adjacent to and along the Nara valley support our reconstructions of a better-watered past for this dry region. In upper Sindh (
                Fig. P1
                B
                and
                C
                ), good preservation of Harappan sites on the alluvial plain suggests that the Indus mega-ridge has been relatively stable. In contrast, in the southwestern Sindh, any settlement on the alluvial plain that may have existed is now buried under fluvial deposits.
              
            
            
              Morphodynamics of the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
              
                Our analysis reveals a palimpsest of fluvial forms and deposits in the western region of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (
                Fig. P1
                A
                ); however, one constant trait that is evident across the entire Harappan landscape is the change from an energetic fluvial regime earlier in the Holocene to increased stability of alluvial forms by Early Harappan times, as the climate became more arid (
                3
                ). In contrast to the alluvial megafans of the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain, we document that rivers in Punjab incised after approximately 10,000 y ago, but before approximately 3,900 y ago, probably driven by sediment load declining during centuries-long weak monsoon periods (
                4
                ). Speculations have advanced the idea that the Ghaggar-Hakra, at times identified with the lost mythical Sarasvati River, was a large glacier-fed Himalayan river. Potential sources for this river include the Yamuna River, the Sutlej River, or both rivers, but the absence of wide, deeply entrenched valleys between the Sutlej and the Yamuna (
                Fig. P1
                A
                ) demonstrates that large, glacier-fed rivers did not flow across the Ghaggar-Hakra region during the Holocene. However, our evidence shows widespread fluvial redistribution of sediment, suggesting that monsoon rains were able to sustain perennial rivers and explaining why Harappan settlements flourished along the entire Ghaggar-Hakra system. Further south, we document fluvial deposition during Harappan times both at the confluence region between the Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra systems and along channels running through the desert toward the Nara valley. The Nara itself, which runs parallel to the Indus, had active fluvial sedimentation approximately 2,900 y ago (
                Fig. P1
                A
                ). Downstream, in Sindh, the Indus River built a unique distributive-type fluvial system that we term the Indus fluvial mega-ridge (
                Fig. P1
                A
                ). The alluvial plain here is convex-up, showing maximum aggradation near the modern channel belt and tapering out toward the plain edges. Radiocarbon-dated deposits of old channel belts indicate that aggradation was minimal during the last approximately 3,000 y compared to earlier in the Holocene, which indicates that the development of the Indus fluvial mega-ridge was the direct consequence of late Holocene aridity (
                3
                ). The reduction in sediment load compared to water discharge linked to monsoon weakening can explain the channel incision and stabilization.
              
            
            
              Brief Harappan History.
              
                The Harappan cultural tradition (

                ,
                2
                ) evolved during an Early Phase (5,200–4,500 y ago) from antecedent agricultural communities of the hills bordering the Indus alluvial plain to the west and reached its urban peak (Mature Phase) between approximately 4,500 and 3,900 y ago. The Harappans were agrarian, but developed large, architecturally complex urban centers and a sophisticated material culture coupled with a robust trade system. In contrast to Egypt and the neighboring hydraulic civilization of Mesopotamia, Harappans did not develop large-scale canal irrigation. Deurbanization after approximately 3,900 y ago was characterized by increasingly regional artifact styles and trading networks and the disappearance of the Harappan script (

                ,
                2

	abstract = {This thesis investigates which products were used in ceramic vessels by populations of the Indus Civilisation through ceramic lipid residue analysis. It uses concepts of food choice and foodways to explore the culinary practices of Indus populations. Specifically, the thesis examines how vessels may have been used in urban and rural Indus settlements located in northwest India during the urban period (c. 2600/2500-1900 {BC}), and identifies whether changes in vessel use occurred in the post-urban period (c. 1900- 1300 {BC}). It also analyses a small sample of Arabian and Indus-origin vessels from the Umm an-Nar period (c. 2400-2000 {BC}) in the Sultanate of Oman. As the first large-scale investigation into Indus foodstuff and vessel-use using lipid residue analysis, the thesis first tests the viability of the method in the South Asian context. It compares lipid yields from pottery recovered from collections, washed pottery from recent excavations, and unwashed pottery from fresh excavations. It then integrates the molecular and compound-specific isotopic data with available bioarchaeological evidence from the study region to reconstruct which products were used in vessels at different sites. The results indicate that overall, lipid residues are typically poorly preserved in Indus vessels, but the acidified methanol extraction technique provides a good lipid recovery rate. No significant differences in lipid yield are observable between washed pottery samples and those collected directly from the field, which suggests that washed pottery may serve as a good source for samples for future lipid residue analysis. However, it is difficult to interpret lipid evidence from samples obtained from collections with limited contextual information, suggesting that future lipid analyses in South Asia must be carefully planned to yield optimum results. The molecular results indicate that animal fats were primarily used in vessels, with minor indications of plant products. The compound-specific results suggest processing of different animal fats, primarily non-ruminants, however, equivocally, many vessels may also have been used to store or process mixtures of products. Inter-site differences in vessel use are observed, but there are broad similarities in vessel-use between urban and rural sites. No change over time in vessel use is observed at rural sites, suggesting stability of food choices. No correlations are observed between vessel-form and products used in vessels, indicating their multifunctionality. These results provide a new means by which to investigate Indus foodways, broadening our understanding of what ancient Indus cuisine at both urban and rural settlements may have looked like.},

	abstract = {Although no historical information exists about the Indus civilization (flourished ca. 2600–1900 B.C.), archaeologists have uncovered about 3,800 short samples of a script that was used throughout the civilization. The script remains undeciphered, despite a large number of attempts and claimed decipherments over the past 80 years. Here, we propose the use of probabilistic models to analyze the structure of the Indus script. The goal is to reveal, through probabilistic analysis, syntactic patterns that could point the way to eventual decipherment. We illustrate the approach using a simple Markov chain model to capture sequential dependencies between signs in the Indus script. The trained model allows new sample texts to be generated, revealing recurring patterns of signs that could potentially form functional subunits of a possible underlying language. The model also provides a quantitative way of testing whether a particular string belongs to the putative language as captured by the Markov model. Application of this test to Indus seals found in Mesopotamia and other sites in West Asia reveals that the script may have been used to express different content in these regions. Finally, we show how missing, ambiguous, or unreadable signs on damaged objects can be filled in with most likely predictions from the model. Taken together, our results indicate that the Indus script exhibits rich synactic structure and the ability to represent diverse content. both of which are suggestive of a linguistic writing system rather than a nonlinguistic symbol system.},

According to records about the stars ―on duty‖ on the first day of each month in Dongba classics, I suggest the star from the constellation ―human‖ should be in agreement with the Dongba tradition.

However, the genetic history of the populations in the Corridor is far from clear due to limited sampling in the northern part of the Corridor.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: We collected blood samples from 10 Tibetan and 10 Han Chinese individuals from Gansu province and genotyped about 600,000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}).
{RESULTS}: Our data revealed that the populations in the Corridor are all admixed on a genetic cline of deriving ancestry from Tibetans on the Plateau and surrounding lowland East Asians. The Tibetan and Han Chinese groups in the north of the Plateau show significant evidence of low-level West Eurasian admixture that could be probably traced back to 600∼900 years ago.
{DISCUSSION}: We conclude that there have been huge population migrations from surrounding lowland onto the Tibetan Plateau via the Tibetan-Yi Corridor since the initial formation of Tibetans probably in Neolithic Time, which leads to the current genetic structure of Tibeto-Burman speaking populations.},

Recent linguistic and genetic studies have traced its origin to Neolithic millet farmers in the Yellow River region of China around 8,000 y ago and also suggested that initial divergence among branches of Sino-Tibetan coincided with expansion of the Neolithic Yangshao culture to the west and southwest during the sixth millennium {BP}. However, archaeological investigations to date have been insufficient to understand the lifeways of these migrant Proto Sino-Tibetan speakers. Here, we present the results of the interdisciplinary research on the material culture and ritual activities related to the initial southwestward migration of Yangshao populations, based on evidence from microfossil remains on ceramics at three sites in Gansu and Sichuan, regional archaeological contexts, and ethnographic accounts of modern Gyalrong Tibetans. The first Yangshao migrants may have integrated with indigenous hunter-gatherers in the {NW} Sichuan highlands, and adopted broad-spectrum subsistence strategies, consisting of both millet farming and foraging for local wild resources. Meanwhile, the migrants appear to have retained important ritual traditions previously established in their Yellow River homelands. They prepared qu starter with Monascus mold and rice for brewing alcoholic beverages, which may have been consumed in communal drinking festivals associated with the performance of ritual dancing. Such ritual activities, which to some extent have survived in the skorbro-zajiu ceremonies in {SW} China, may have then played a central role in maintaining and reinforcing cultural identities, social values, and connections with the homelands of the Proto Sino-Tibetan migrants.},

The small size of the corpus, the absence of bilingual texts, and the lack of definite knowledge of the underlying language has frustrated efforts at decipherment since the discovery of the remains of the Indus civilisation. Recently, some researchers have questioned the premise that the Indus script encodes spoken language. Building on previous statistical approaches, we apply the tools of statistical language processing, specifically \$n\$-gram Markov chains, to analyse the Indus script for syntax. Our main results are that the script has well-defined signs which begin and end texts, that there is directionality and strong correlations in the sign order, and that there are groups of signs which appear to have identical syntactic function. All these require no \{{\textbackslash}it a priori\} suppositions regarding the syntactic or semantic content of the signs, but follow directly from the statistical analysis. Using information theoretic measures, we find the information in the script to be intermediate between that of a completely random and a completely fixed ordering of signs. Our study reveals that the Indus script is a structured sign system showing features of a formal language, but, at present, cannot conclusively establish that it encodes \{{\textbackslash}it natural\} language. Our \$n\$-gram Markov model is useful for predicting signs which are missing or illegible in a corpus of Indus texts. This work forms the basis for the development of a stochastic grammar which can be used to explore the syntax of the Indus script in greater detail.},

	shorttitle = {Swin Transformer},
	abstract = {This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with {\textbackslash}textbf\{S\}hifted {\textbackslash}textbf\{win\}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on {ImageNet}-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box {AP} and 51.1 mask {AP} on {COCO} test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 {mIoU} on {ADE}20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box {AP} and +2.6 mask {AP} on {COCO}, and +3.2 {mIoU} on {ADE}20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-{MLP} architectures.

In this article, we collected 2922 handwritten single word samples of commonly used ancient Yi characters. Each character was written by 310 people respectively, with a total of 427,939 valid characters. We completed continuous handwritten text sampling, written by 250 people, with 5 texts per person, covering topics such as Yi astronomy, geography, rituals, and agriculture. In the process of data collection, we proposed an automatic sampling method for ancient Yi script, and completed the automatic cutting and labeling of handwritten samples. Furthermore, we tested the recognition performance of the sorted data set under different deep learning network models. The results show that ancient Yi script has diverse shape structures and rich writing styles, which can be used as a benchmark data set in related fields such as handwritten text recognition and handwritten text generation.},

	abstract = {The emergence and intensification of transcontinental exchange during both the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age profoundly influenced the social history of Eurasia. While scholars have intensively discussed east-west long-distance communication along the proto-Silk Road, the north-south transport networks that connected China to South and Southeast Asia during the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age have attracted much less attention in the scholarly literature based on archeological science data. In this paper, we find new radiocarbon dates from 11 Neolithic and Bronze Age sites in northwestern and central Yunnan in Southwest China, a key entrance into South and Southeast Asia from China. Combined with previously published archeological records and radiocarbon dates, we attempt to disentangle and understand the timing and routes of the networks linking China to South and Southeast Asia during the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age. We propose three north-south land routes that played essential roles in the cultural exchanges in addition to the proto-Silk Road and maritime routes. This includes the trans-Himalayan routes, trans-Hengduan Mountain routes, and the trans-Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau routes. The north-south exchange between China and South and Southeast Asia probably emerged in the fifth millennium {BP} (before the present) mainly through a low-frequency trans-Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau and trans-Himalayan routes. The exchange frequency significantly increased after the fourth millennium {BP}, with the synchronous development of the three primary north-south passageways. Trans-Hengduan routes might have been the most crucial artery connecting China and South and Southeast Asia during 3000–2200 {BP}, but more archeological records are needed to understand the detailed evolution of these transport networks.},

	abstract = {Located in the central Eurasia, the Tibetan Plateau ({TP}) is a key area for the spread of culture, technology, and species. However, the Plateau’s role in the prehistoric food globalization has been underestimated due to the lack of archeological materials. The Qugong site was the only scientifically excavated site in the central {TP} up to now. It is the earliest and among the most important prehistoric settlements in the central {TP}, with charcoals dated to 3750–3500 cal. {BP}. Wild deer (Cervidae) and domesticated yak (Bos grunniens) and sheep (Ovis aries) remains were unearthed, but no archeobotanical studies had been conducted. Here we present new radiocarbon data from charred seeds as well as archeobotanical data of the Qugong site. Dating back to 3400 cal. {BP}, there were foxtail millet (Setaria italica), broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum), wheat (Triticum aestivum), hulled barley (Hordeum vulgare), naked barley (Hordeum vulgare var. nudum), and bitter buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) identified at this site. We propose that millets in the central {TP} came from the eastern {TP}, while wheat and barley here probably came from northern South Asia. It indicates that the Eastern and Western cultures arrived in the central {TP} in prehistory via different routes in late fourth millennium {BP}. The intercultural communications not only flourished the prehistoric central {TP} but also laid the foundation for the later ‘Highland Silk Road’.},

	doi = {10.1007/s12520-010-0035-y},
	abstract = {Major leaps forward in understanding rice both in genetics and archaeology have taken place in the past decade or so—with
the publication of full draft genomes for indica and japonica rice, on the one hand, and with the spread of systematic flotation and increased recovery of archaeological spikelet bases
and other rice remains on early sites in China, India and Southeast Asia. This paper will sketch a framework that coherently
integrates the evidence from these burgeoning fields. This framework implies a reticulate framework in the phylogeny of early
cultivated rice, with multiple starts of cultivation (two is perhaps not enough) but with the key consolidations of adaptations
that must have been spread through hybridisation and therefore long-distance cultural contacts. Archaeobotanical evidence
allows us to document the gradual evolutionary process of domestication through rice spikelet bases and grain size change.
Separate trends in grain size change can be identified in India and China. The earliest centre of rice domestication was in
the Yangtze basin of China, but a largely separate trajectory into rice cultivation can be traced in the Ganges plains of
India. Intriguingly, contact-induced hybridisation is indicated for the early development of indica in northern India, ca. 2000BC. An updated synthesis of the interwoven patterns of the spread of various rice varieties throughout
Asia and to Madagascar can be suggested in which rice reached most of its historical range of important cultivation by the
Iron Age.

Floating point numbers are known for their very large and very small number representations such as beyond {CPU} 64-bit integer supporting range at the expense of loosely controlled accuracy. In Go, floating-point number conversion is only limited to Base-10 to Base-2 numbering representations. To convert into other base number representations like Base-8, Base-16, Base-9, the converter is currently unavailable. To support such conversion, there is a need to investigate a way to convert floating-point number from one base numbering representation to another. This paper first reviews floating-point number fundamentals like working mechanism in mathematics and computer science domains. The goal is to understand floating point number's role and working mechanisms. Then, the paper reviews its definitions, parts, requirements, tradeoff, and operating algorithms related to seek out available math functionalities in Go programming language. Next the paper derives and tests the base conversion algorithm based on the available resources. Lastly, the paper specifies its limitation based on the test results and concluded the derived algorithm.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the {ImageNet} dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than {VGG} nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the {ImageNet} test set. This result won the 1st place on the {ILSVRC} 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on {CIFAR}-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the {COCO} object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to {ILSVRC} \& {COCO} 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of {ImageNet} detection, {ImageNet} localization, {COCO} detection, and {COCO} segmentation.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

	abstract = {Vision transformers have been successfully applied to image recognition tasks due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies within an image. However, there are still gaps in both performance and computational cost between transformers and existing convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}). In this paper, we aim to address this issue and develop a network that can outperform not only the canonical transformers, but also the high-performance convolutional models. We propose a new transformer based hybrid network by taking advantage of transformers to capture long-range dependencies, and of {CNNs} to model local features. Furthermore, we scale it to obtain a family of models, called {CMTs}, obtaining much better accuracy and efficiency than previous convolution and transformer based models. In particular, our {CMT}-S achieves 83.5\% top-1 accuracy on {ImageNet}, while being 14x and 2x smaller on {FLOPs} than the existing {DeiT} and {EfficientNet}, respectively. The proposed {CMT}-S also generalizes well on {CIFAR}10 (99.2\%), {CIFAR}100 (91.7\%), Flowers (98.7\%), and other challenging vision datasets such as {COCO} (44.3\% {mAP}), with considerably less computational cost.},

	abstract = {Background and Objective
Most studies used neural activities evoked by linguistic stimuli such as phrases or sentences to decode the language structure. However, compared to linguistic stimuli, it is more common for the human brain to perceive the outside world through non-linguistic stimuli such as natural images, so only relying on linguistic stimuli cannot fully understand the information perceived by the human brain. To address this, an end-to-end mapping model between visual neural activities evoked by non-linguistic stimuli and visual contents is demanded.
Methods
Inspired by the success of the Transformer network in neural machine translation and the convolutional neural network ({CNN}) in computer vision, here a {CNN}-Transformer hybrid language decoding model is constructed in an end-to-end fashion to decode functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) signals evoked by natural images into descriptive texts about the visual stimuli. Specifically, this model first encodes a semantic sequence extracted by a two-layer 1D {CNN} from the multi-time visual neural activity into a multi-level abstract representation, then decodes this representation, step by step, into an English sentence.
Results
Experimental results show that the decoded texts are semantically consistent with the corresponding ground truth annotations. Additionally, by varying the encoding and decoding layers and modifying the original positional encoding of the Transformer, we found that a specific architecture of the Transformer is required in this work.
Conclusions
The study results indicate that the proposed model can decode the visual neural activities evoked by natural images into descriptive text about the visual stimuli in the form of sentences. Hence, it may be considered as a potential computer-aided tool for neuroscientists to understand the neural mechanism of visual information processing in the human brain in the future.},

In this study, our focus lies in developing an automated system for effectively identifying the script of historical documents using a deep learning approach. Leveraging the {ClAMM} dataset as the foundation for our system, we initiate the system with dataset preprocessing, employing two fundamental techniques: denoising through non-local means denoising and binarization using Canny-edge detection. These techniques prepare the document for keypoint detection facilitated by the Harris-corner detector, a feature-detection method. Subsequently, we cluster these keypoints utilizing the k-means algorithm and extract patches based on the identified features. The final step involves training these patches on deep learning models, with a comparative analysis between two architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNN}) and Vision Transformers ({ViT}). Given the absence of prior studies investigating the performance of vision transformers on historical manuscripts, our research fills this gap. The system undergoes a series of experiments to fine-tune its parameters for optimal performance. Our conclusive results demonstrate an average accuracy of 89.2 and 91.99\% respectively of the {CNN} and {ViT} based proposed framework, surpassing the state of the art in historical script classification so far, and affirming the effectiveness of our automated script identification system.},

While convolutional networks ({CNNs}) have been the best for analysing medical images, recent interest has emerged in leveraging vision transformers ({ViTs}) for medical data analysis. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive comparison of three systems a self-attention transformer ({VIT}), a compact convolution transformer ({CCT}), and a tokenlearner ({TVIT}) for binary classification of mammography images into benign and cancerous tissue. Thorough experiments were performed using the {DDSM} dataset, which consists of 5970 benign and 7158 malignant images. The performance accuracy of the proposed models was evaluated, yielding results of 99.81\% for {VIT}, 99.92\% for {CCT}, and 99.05\% for {TVIT}. Additionally, the study compared these results with the current state-of-the-art performance metrics. The findings demonstrate how convolution-attention mechanisms can effectively contribute to the development of robust computer-aided systems for diagnosing breast cancer. Notably, the proposed approach achieves high-performance results while also minimizing the computational resources required and reducing decision time.},

We simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on {ImageNet}. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by {SimCLR} achieves 76.5\% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7\% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised {ResNet}-50. When fine-tuned on only 1\% of the labels, we achieve 85.8\% top-5 accuracy, outperforming {AlexNet} with 100X fewer labels.},

Quantifying predictive uncertainty in {NNs} is a challenging and yet unsolved problem. Bayesian {NNs}, which learn a distribution over weights, are currently the state-of-the-art for estimating predictive uncertainty; however these require significant modifications to the training procedure and are computationally expensive compared to standard (non-Bayesian) {NNs}. We propose an alternative to Bayesian {NNs} that is simple to implement, readily parallelizable, requires very little hyperparameter tuning, and yields high quality predictive uncertainty estimates. Through a series of experiments on classification and regression benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates which are as good or better than approximate Bayesian {NNs}. To assess robustness to dataset shift, we evaluate the predictive uncertainty on test examples from known and unknown distributions, and show that our method is able to express higher uncertainty on out-of-distribution examples. We demonstrate the scalability of our method by evaluating predictive uncertainty estimates on {ImageNet}.},

	abstract = {We propose a technique for producing "visual explanations" for decisions from a large class of {CNN}-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-{CAM}), uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Grad-{CAM} is applicable to a wide variety of {CNN} model-families: (1) {CNNs} with fully-connected layers, (2) {CNNs} used for structured outputs, (3) {CNNs} used in tasks with multimodal inputs or reinforcement learning, without any architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-{CAM} with fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization and apply it to off-the-shelf image classification, captioning, and visual question answering ({VQA}) models, including {ResNet}-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into their failure modes, (b) are robust to adversarial images, (c) outperform previous methods on localization, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model and (e) help achieve generalization by identifying dataset bias. For captioning and {VQA}, we show that even non-attention based models can localize inputs. We devise a way to identify important neurons through Grad-{CAM} and combine it with neuron names to provide textual explanations for model decisions. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-{CAM} helps users establish appropriate trust in predictions from models and show that Grad-{CAM} helps untrained users successfully discern a 'stronger' nodel from a 'weaker' one even when both make identical predictions.

	abstract = {Deep neural networks have enabled progress in a wide variety of applications. Growing the size of the neural network typically results in improved accuracy. As model sizes grow, the memory and compute requirements for training these models also increases. We introduce a technique to train deep neural networks using half precision floating point numbers. In our technique, weights, activations and gradients are stored in {IEEE} half-precision format. Half-precision floating numbers have limited numerical range compared to single-precision numbers. We propose two techniques to handle this loss of information. Firstly, we recommend maintaining a single-precision copy of the weights that accumulates the gradients after each optimizer step. This single-precision copy is rounded to half-precision format during training. Secondly, we propose scaling the loss appropriately to handle the loss of information with half-precision gradients. We demonstrate that this approach works for a wide variety of models including convolution neural networks, recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. This technique works for large scale models with more than 100 million parameters trained on large datasets. Using this approach, we can reduce the memory consumption of deep learning models by nearly 2x. In future processors, we can also expect a significant computation speedup using half-precision hardware units.},

	abstract = {The Valley of Kashmir in the western Himalayas holds a large number of Neolithic sites that are part of a loosely affiliated group of prehistoric cultures occupying mountains and valleys in the north of the Indian subcontinent – the Northern Neolithic. Despite extensive excavations at several sites in the 20th century, full reports on key sites are still lacking. As a result of this a number of issues have arisen, including a poorly resolved internal chronology based in part on relative dating of ceramics, as well as unclear or speculative links to neighbouring cultures. This study reports new absolute dates, botanical materials and ceramic analyses resulting from preliminary survey and testing work aimed at rectifying these problems. A thorough synthesis of previously reported excavation data is also provided, and considered alongside the newly reported material. This has allowed us to contextualise the development of the Neolithic in Kashmir against a growing number of recent studies on the spread of early dry-farming agricultural villages in the mountain zones of South Asia. The long term cultural and economic stability of the Northern Neolithic in Kashmir has allowed us to situate it as an important niche within a wider network of agriculturalist-pastoralist exchange taking place between the mountain zones and the settled areas of Inner Asia during the 3rd- 2nd millennia {BCE}.},

	abstract = {Deep ensembles have been empirically shown to be a promising approach for improving accuracy, uncertainty and out-of-distribution robustness of deep learning models. While deep ensembles were theoretically motivated by the bootstrap, non-bootstrap ensembles trained with just random initialization also perform well in practice, which suggests that there could be other explanations for why deep ensembles work well. Bayesian neural networks, which learn distributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically well-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep ensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible explanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable variational Bayesian methods tend to focus on a single mode, whereas deep ensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space. We investigate this hypothesis by building on recent work on understanding the loss landscape of neural networks and adding our own exploration to measure the similarity of functions in the space of predictions. Our results show that random initializations explore entirely different modes, while functions along an optimization trajectory or sampled from the subspace thereof cluster within a single mode predictions-wise, while often deviating significantly in the weight space. Developing the concept of the diversity--accuracy plane, we show that the decorrelation power of random initializations is unmatched by popular subspace sampling methods. Finally, we evaluate the relative effects of ensembling, subspace based methods and ensembles of subspace based methods, and the experimental results validate our hypothesis.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore and compare multiple solutions to the problem of data augmentation in image classification. Previous work has demonstrated the effectiveness of data augmentation through simple techniques, such as cropping, rotating, and flipping input images. We artificially constrain our access to data to a small subset of the {ImageNet} dataset, and compare each data augmentation technique in turn. One of the more successful data augmentations strategies is the traditional transformations mentioned above. We also experiment with {GANs} to generate images of different styles. Finally, we propose a method to allow a neural net to learn augmentations that best improve the classifier, which we call neural augmentation. We discuss the successes and shortcomings of this method on various datasets.},

	abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the {ImageNet} {LSVRC}-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5\% and 17.0\%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient {GPU} implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the {ILSVRC}-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},
